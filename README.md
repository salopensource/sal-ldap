# Sal-LDAP

*This code is archived and is left here for historical purposes. It should not be used in production in it's current state.*

This image expanded on Sal and allowed it to leverage LDAP authentication. There were numerous customizations that were necessary - this image is in use and working for several AD environments, but may not 100% work in yours. You should mount your own ``settings.py`` in the container, at least while figuring out what options you need. This image uses [django-auth-ldap](https://pythonhosted.org/django-auth-ldap/index.html_) to connect to LDAP, so please refer to the documentation there if you need more details on the configuration options.
